This utility will prompt you to enter some Arabic or Persian text, and return its total [abjad value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad_numerals). It follows the more common Mashriqi letter order, assigns a value of 1 to _hamzah_ in its [isolated form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza#Orthography), and will ignore the _shaddah_.

For a web app with more options, see https://www.abjadcalc.com/.

Here I've only provided the Rust source files. You'll need to build it yourself, which should be easy.
